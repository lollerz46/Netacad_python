1. A function is a block of code that performs a specific task when the function is called (invoked). You can use functions to make your code reusable, better organized, and more readable. Functions can have parameters and return values.

2. There are at least four basic types of functions in Python:

- built-in functions which are an integral part of Python (such as the `print()` function). You can see a complete list of built-in Python functions at https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html.
- the ones that come from pre-installed modules (you'll learn about them in the Python Essentials 2 course)
- user-defined functions which are written by users for users â€’ you can write your own functions and use them freely in your code,
the `lambda` functions (you'll learn about them in the Python Essentials 2 course.)

3. You can define your own function using the `def` keyword and the following syntax:

```
def your_function(optional parameters):
    # the body of the function
```

You can define a function which doesn't take any arguments, e.g.:

```
def message(): # defining a function
    print("Hello") # body of the function
 
message() # calling the function
``` 

You can define a function which takes arguments, too, just like the one-parameter function below:

```
def hello(name): # defining a function
    print("Hello,", name) # body of the function
 
 
name = input("Enter your name: ")
 
hello(name) # calling the function
```
